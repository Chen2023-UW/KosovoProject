GEOG 778 Capstone Project

Without UN permission, NATO air strikes Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for 78 days, from Mar.24, 1999 to Jun.10, 1999. I have read documentary books and articles regarding to Yugoslavia war and learned air striking locations and its damage to the country. In that case, I believe it is necessary to apply my cartography skills to create an interactive map to demonstrate the striking damage on daily basis. This purposed interactive map, along with my own analysis article of Kosovo war will serve as the primary resource of my video series. My intend audience is people who interested in Europe history after cold war, the dataset could also serve as an open - source resource for following scholars to acquire data if they are intend to analyze similar topic.
